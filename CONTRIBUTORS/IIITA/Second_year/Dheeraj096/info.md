###Ques - 1 How and why merge conflicts arise? (Answer from your own understanding)

###Ans- Acc. to my understanding, a merge conflict happens when you merge two separate branches that contain different changes on the same locations in the same file and it's unclear which change should take precedence or whether both should be combined.

###Ques - 2 Is force push a good practice? Yes/No why? In most of the tasks on this repo, you used force push, so why this practice is Okay (neither good nor bad) in your case?

###Ans - In short according to me it is not a good practise because Force-pushing is a highly threatening and risky method if you're working in a common repository. Using this force pushing you should be able to force your local revision to the remote repository.Like if many people are working on same issue then Force modifying the git history can get your collaborators out of sync but if you alone who is working on that issue then it is ok.



Ques - What do you really understand from SSH keys? What are the advantages of using it?


Ans  - Basically from my understanding SSH keys are secure alternate to email and password like we don't have to write everytime email and password for authentication. SSH key  is automated for implementing single sign-on system method. It comes in pairs <public and private>  public key -  sharing with github. private key - stays on local machine. As when both keys matches we are allowed to make changes.

  Advantage:-
  
  SSH keys are much securer and easier because we don't have to write anything email and password. Also there is no chance of spelling mistake.
  
  It easily identify yourself no one can identify our private informations like password.
